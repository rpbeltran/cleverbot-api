# Cleverbot Webscraping API for Python
#
# Made By: Ryan Beltran
#
# On: March 30th 2016
#
# Version history:
#    1.0  3/30/16
#
# Todo list:
#    * Disguise traffic as human
#    * Make ask() more resilient to changes in site structure
#    * Add reset operation by clearing CBSTATE cookie
#    * Save sessions by storing raw CBSTATE's (and perhaps SESSIONIDs; experimentation needed)
#    * Filter inappropriate responces
#    * Filter self advertisements from Cleverbot
#    * Further optimize the ask() function
#

#
# Disclaimer
#
# Please use webscrapers responcibly and practice fair and legal discression when deciding on how and if a scraper should be used.
# Under precedent from previous court cases including 'Ebay V. Bidders Edge', the use of a web scraper in ways that interfere with the host's intersts may (possibly) be considered illegal trespass.
# Cleverbot does not openly grant site access to robots, or humans attempting to access the site indirectly, and infact statedly denies it.
# Writing this code is not in violation of anyone's Terms of Use. RUNNING this code may be in violation of somebody's Terms of Use.
# If cleverbot blocks you IP address as a result of your use of any of the following code, consider it a personal problem.
# Per my undrstanding, the only authorized ways of using Cleverbot are:
#       * To have a human interface their web application directly at www.cleverbot.com
#       * To pay a heck of a lot of money to use their cleverscript API
# Oh also one quick note, software should be free.
